       "[\"Bought it in January,posting it in August. So i've used it almost 6 months and giving honest review.In short if you are getting it during sale time @899-999,then it's a steal deal..also in regular price b/w 1299-1499 it's a good product..Sound quality is good. Enough loud at 50-60% volume. Bass is also ok. Whenever needed it produces punchy bass. Overall balanced.Mic quality is good in indoor condition,but in noisy environment you can't rely on this. Recevier can't clearly listen to you.You can do gaming as company claiming low latency,i myself didn't test it.Now about battery backup,company claim it will give battery backup of 42 hours with case. 6 hours in single charge+Additional 36 hours(6 times charge via case). But in practical use it gives total 35 hours playback. It will give around 5 hours backup on single charge of buds @ 50-60% volume(if you only listen to music or watching video,but no call or gaming) You can charge the earbuds full 6 times via case: so additional 30 hours.Just one issue with it's design,suit case type box & not easy to carry in pocket. I would say it's a personal preference. If you are into good looks,design then it's not for you.Now it's regular pricing varries between Rs 1299-1499. In this price range also it is one of the best tws under 1500. I will tell why.. now a days many brands are launching tws in the market under 1500. Most of them sound almost similar, difference is like 19/20!! They are just marketing their tws with huge hours of battery backup & by youtubers,reviewers. 48/50 hours of playtime is just myth. I've personally used Truke(Airbuds lite,Buds F1) which is by far the most false promising brand claiming 48 hours of battery in their every tws,but only give 21 hours. Even other tws of boat(Airdopes 121 pro) which claim 40-45 hours playback only give around 25 hours,Defy Gravity Z claiming 50 hours only give 28 hours. If you are impressed by their looks & huge battery backup and thinking to buy those,you will be disappointed after purchase. Instead go with this,you will not be disappointed.\",\n",
       " \"Pros:1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you're at the gym, these are perfect.2. Awesome Bass!3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like Gym.4. Lovely battery life, I've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.6. Affordable!7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.9. Type C portCons:1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so it's great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I'm very very happy with themHighly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc.\",\n",

All the factory reset and all stuff to sort these issues don\\'t work when one of the earbuds is totally dead and unable to charge.4. They are too soft and can easily fall out of ears if you make facial expressions for a minute or two.

       " \"I am writing a true review after around a week long use of these boat airdopes 141 ....CONS1. the mic is average and the voice feels a little modulated on the mic provided .2. the case is little bulky due to longer battery life but you will get used to it in about 2 to 3 days. The case quality is decent but the case lid feels like its built out of crappy plastic and doesnt feel robust or stable in hand.3. these airdopes are based on bluetooth v 5.0 and later and they will work great with all the devices having the same bluetooth version i.e v5.0 or newer however in case of older versions there is a lot of latency lag. I personally use these with my laptop that has v5.0 and they work great however when i connect them with my android phone which has bluetooth v 4.10 , the experience is horrendous ... there are many problems like latency lag,  voice breaks etc even when the bt v.50 is backwards compatible .... i experience this latency lag and voice break during calling , whatsapp calling and playing simple mobile games. Despite all this there is no problem while streaming songs on these airdopes.4. there is a lot of voice leakage if you use them on 100 percent volume both on laptop and mobile phones you will have to tweak them ... the voice is also kind of high so you will not be able to listen to anything on 100 percent anyhow .... 50 to 60 is an ideal level for all the movies and games as well as music.5. Your ears will hurt after prolonged usage of these if you dont select the right size of air caps ... 3 sizes are already provided inside the box.6. The biggest con while using these airdopes on windows is that you cannot use the airdopes and the inbuilt mic together .... windows doesnt allow it even if you try very hard to use both the mic and airdopes output speaker together Its a windows issue but is manageable .7.Another big problem is that the voice control option is absent on the airdopes and the volume cant be controlled from the airdopes ... you will have to control it from the device which is also a big problem .PROS-1. the sound quality and the bass are great .2. the battery life is great you can easily use them for 7 to 8 hours on continuous usage.3. They charge very quickly, in a jiffy.4. They feel even greater if you enable surround sound while using them on windows platform.5. the connectivity is great too ;as soon as you open the case they will automatically detect and connect to the available devices that you paired them with earlier within seconds.6. There is literally zero latency and zero lag on these while connected on the same bluetooth version .... i used these on my laptop and played all the games like cs go, valorant, gta 5, and other games but there is no issue while gaming or music.7.There is a support for mono audio and you can use one airdope at a time instead of using both.8.Boat has provided a year's warranty on these so they can be easily replaced in case of a damage if the damage occurs within the given time frame .Overall the product can be optimized a bit more but is still good to use now and is a decent purchase on this price point ; however better options are available if you intend to use it just for calling purpose , better go with something wired or something that comes with older bt versions if you intend to use them with devices with older bluetooth versions .\",\n",

       " \"My review is a little bit long(sorry!) but I have shared my genuine experience after 7 days of use, it will help you decide whether you want to have these or not:Review [Day 3] (read review on last day of return below this):I loved these airdopes, tested it's batteries after 5 days of use, there doesn't seem to be any problem till now (as most of the reviews had problem related to charging and battery backup.)I am a casual user, music listener and video watcher, so for me it is simply the best.I previously encountered electrical interference in latest launched earbuds which is not at all present in these.Also, the feel of having these in ears is really soft, I used them throughout the day and they were great.Now, bass is quite down in these, also with 8 mm driver it is not that good with low frequency sounds. But it's just a minor loss nothing serious.At 999/- It can assure you BoAt service for a year and also great Battery backup.Earbuds : 5:30 hrCase : 5 times chargedNot 42 hours but around 30-32 hours overall.Not fit to enjoy gaming for hardcore gamers but great for casual gaming.ENC is present but I would say it is very light or rather negligible.Range is 5-7 m (with walls in between.)I charged it @ 10% battery first time, but will try to charge @ 30% or above from now to increase charging cycles. I was confused when to charge them, but apparently it's better to charge them as soon as you don't need them to have a good battery life, also avoid going below 10%.Right now with so many variants out there I believe if you do have a need of earbuds for normal use, these are the best.And one more thing don't forget to check whether the airdopes come to you with plastic sealed box or not. If they are not sealed in plastic then there is high chance of these being a returned product, which may or may not be as good as the one right out of the factory product.[Day 7 with some problems resolved]#Prob 1:The sound abruptly reduced, what I was getting earlier at 40% volume level now became 100% volume level.Prob #2:Also, the pair is not connecting as it should i.e. on opening the caseNow I am deciding to return the product as it is the last day, but suddenly I remembered: The Troubleshooting manual, and tried the following:Solution#:Unpair from the Bluetooth and pair again (even reset it if you want but first unpair it.)Do this 👆👆👆👆 and most probably the disconnecting one side bud or bad volume level will be reset and hopefully will become the same as when we received.Note: But there is this issue of it getting functioning faulty and that when I thoroughly took care of it, never dropped it, softly handled it, charged above 40% etc. So technically these airdopes are not perfected for long use, you may notice some misbehaviour from time to time, but most probably the problem can be reset. So do decide whether to purchase these or not knowing this!I hope it helps you, as I was finding this kind of review before purchase but there were none!This is purely based on my review after I was irritated with some ENC variants of Rs 1500-2000 range. Due to their ENC feature, I noticed electrical interference/buzzing noise.I am keeping it finally as it has at least no buzzing or irritating noise, comes from a known brand at a low budget.Update (After 3 months): This pair is still working fine. I have noticed the battery is not that better as it was initially but it is enough for 3-5 time charge (not from 0% but randomly after each use, generally from 30-50%). They will easily last you at least a day with the charging case in one charge. (Remember one day is the least, if you don't use it like crazy they can even last 2 days). I have noticed though for me using them for long does generate pain in ears (by long I mean for about 4-5 hours straight, I use them while studying to cutoff outside noises, which they perfectly do for me.) Hope it helps to share it's update over a period of use. I always look for such reviews but nobody writes so I thought let it be me only😇!\"]"

       "10  Bought it in January,posting it in August. So i've used it almost 6 months and giving honest review.In short if you are getting it during sale time @899-999,then it's a steal deal..also in regular price b/w 1299-1499 it's a good product..Sound quality is good. Enough loud at 50-60% volume. Bass is also ok. Whenever needed it produces punchy bass. Overall balanced.Mic quality is good in indoor condition,but in noisy environment you can't rely on this. Recevier can't clearly listen to you.You can do gaming as company claiming low latency,i myself didn't test it.Now about battery backup,company claim it will give battery backup of 42 hours with case. 6 hours in single charge+Additional 36 hours(6 times charge via case). But in practical use it gives total 35 hours playback. It will give a...\n",

Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like Gym.4. Lovely battery life, I've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.6.

       "14  After 10-12 days of regular use1) I felt size of airdopes is little bit large that's why it doesn't fit into ear properly and if I run then I get feel that it will fell from my ear2) as its large in size and can't fit in ear properly due to which I have to adjust with sound quality, if I will keep my hand on it and will press little bit into my ear then bass and sound will be perfectly okay but we cannot keep hand on airpodes all the time to push it into ear to get perfect quality of sound3) around after 45 days , if box is closed then also airpodes will connect to the mobile automatically then I have to open the box and close it roughly 2-3 times in order to close it properly and disconnect it4) my left side airdope sometime don't get charged even after putting it in box for whole day...\n",
